# Hopfield Neural Network Image Restoration

## Project Description

This project implements a Hopfield network for restoring images corrupted by various types of noise. The project includes loading images from the MNIST dataset, processing them using the Hopfield network, and visualizing the restoration results.

## Project Structure

The project is stored in the `master` branch.

The project consists of the following files and folders:

- `images.py`: Contains functions for loading and processing images.
- `hopfield.py`: Contains functions for implementing the Hopfield network and restoring images.
- `plot.py`: Contains functions for visualizing the results.
- `run.py`: The main file to run the project.
- `train/`: Folder for storing training images.
- `test/`: Folder for storing test images with different types of noise.
- `outputs/`: Folder for storing restored images.

## Runnig the project

To run the project, execute the main file `run.py`. This will initiate the loading and processing of images.
